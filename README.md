# 🧠 Deep Research Agent
A modular AI agent for automated deep research, built with Python, smol-agents framework, and LangFlow. Explores advanced architectures, LLM optimization, and multi-database integration.

## 🚀 Overview
This repo implements a production-oriented deep research agent capable of:
- Automated knowledge synthesis (academic papers, technical docs, web sources).
- Multi-agent architectures (MCP, A2A) for collaborative research tasks.
- Hybrid data pipelines (SQL + Graph + Vector DBs) for structured/unstructured data.
- LLM optimization (quantization, fine-tuning, distillation) for cost-efficient inference.
- Key differentiator: Beyond prototyping, I focus on scalable deployment (LangFlow UI, API endpoints) and comparative benchmarks of techniques.

## Key Features:
- 🤖 Multi-agent coordination for complex research tasks
- 🗃️ Hybrid data layer (SQLite + Neo4j + Qdrant)
- ⚡ LLM optimization (GGUF quantization, LoRA fine-tuning)
- 🚀 From Jupyter prototypes to LangFlow UI deployment

## 🔧 Core Components
#### 1. Architectures

- MCP (Manager-Controller-Processor) vs A2A (Agent-to-Agent) frameworks.
- Benchmarking coordination efficiency (task latency, error recovery).

#### 2. Data Layer
1. Database wars:
    - SQL (SQLite) for structured metadata.
    - Graph DB (Neo4j) for knowledge relationships.
    - Vector DB (Qdrant) for RAG pipelines.
2. Embedding strategies:
    - Custom vs pretrained.

3. LLM Foundations
    - Model zoo: Comparing OSS (Mistral, Llama3) vs proprietary (GPT-4-turbo).
    - Optimization: Quantization (GGUF, bitsandbytes).
    - Fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA) for domain adaptation.
    - Distillation (tiny-llama as target).

4. Agent Logic
    - Human-in-the-loop: validation for critical steps.
    - Vanilla LLMs: Task decomposition with smolagents (HuggingFace).
